#Introduction:

The brief was to create an application which used CRUD functionality by using the core modules covered in training:

Project management - A Kanban Jira board with Epics and user stories. Code is integrated into a version Control system.

Databases - A relational database to store persistant data from the front end.

Java SE and Spring Boot - back end application created in OOP language which follows the criteria created in the Jira board.

Testing - Integration testing for the Spring boot backend and coverage at 94.1%. Front end testing carried out by acting as application user and testing all CRUD functionalities.

Front-End development - A front end created using HTML, JavaScript and CSS which connects to the Spring boot backend.
